# This project is a time scheduled crawler to get data from foursquare's API.
## Libraries used :
1. Serverless Framework
2. AWS SDK
3. TurfJS

## Data sources
1. coordinates.csv is converted from Singapore Land Authority Cadastral Map's KML file
2. Currently still in 900m x 600m squares
3. coordinates.csv contains centre points of the squares.

## Improvements
1. Change server to write to file instead?
2. Change coordinates in between each point.
